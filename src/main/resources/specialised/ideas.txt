test all the inventories especially the ones listed below, does blastfurnace actually allow to edit stuff?



check if its worth adding craft listeners? probably not...


test some of the odd inventories.

abstract horse, lectern, double chest, Jokebox, Chisseled bookshelf, loot table, merchent, player

some are missing, smokter, blast furnace, droper hopper, dispenser




add custom inventory returns that provide utility for said inventory









Beacon, Cartography, Enchanter, GrindStone , Loom

work but the items won't show up for some reason
